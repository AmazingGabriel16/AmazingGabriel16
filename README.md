Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Computer Science to make a less deviant Connor.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... Idk, just projects I guess or whatever I stumble upon.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... The unofficial Novel AI APK. Android subject was cancelled in university, so I'm taking a deep dive.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... Games, because I love games! Well, you can basically ask me anything I guess?
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... Email, a ping or via Discord. VRChat works too, but I hope you don't mind us being in a cozy snow world.

Hi there,

My name is Gab and I'm just another otaku on the internet.

During the semesters, I'll be working on university assignments, but other than that, I'll be working (or try working on) the unofficial NAI webview APK to try to help out the commmunity there, since web browsers are ugly. In addition to that, I'll be working on some personal projects, it won't make the activity page on my GitHub profile green to the web like the other devs out there, but that's okay :)

I'm a university graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science to try and make a less deviant Connor... until of course I decide it's time to make Detroit Become Human XD
Due to me not being big brain enough and me being unable to get into certain subjects like Android development and image recognition, you're gonna be seeing a lot of butchered half-baked what in the world code as I try learn and write new code language and concepts, as well as try to smooth things out, one bug at a time, hopefully faster than Hi-Rez can produce them. However, it won't be spaghetti code and will have a good base, layout and a lot of planning... hopefully... if I am not forced to fill though.

For collabs, basically anything, but we do need a bigger brain for the NAI webview APK. Downloading JSON files is a pain, and man web stuff is so hard and confusing I'm lucky that Bootstrap exists.

What can you ask me?
Games! :D

Well I guess you can ask me anything, but don't question why I love Ying Reso or you're not getting healed! >:D

To contact me, you can do so via email, Discord, a ping, Discord, Discord... VRCHAT!
Just hope you don't mind if we're in a cozy snow world... it's nice! :D

Fun (too many because I am bored) facts:
- I will give you boops because I am now able to! XD
- I like drawing, writing and gaming.
- I don't have a good sleep schedule, so basically available 24/7 unless I crash due to the NotEnoughSleepToMuchUniWork exception.

1.19 changes:
+ Added Python
- Removed Herobrine
- Athena was here.
